# Weather Trends

[Try the tool here!](http://54.175.13.213/)

This is a tool for exploring weather trends over time. 1980 - the first year the tool offers searching from - is hardly a long time ago in one respect. With that said, it *is* long enough ago that we can start to see trends take shape over the recent decades, and it allows us to put in context present day environmental measurements.

Why did I make this? I've recently developed an interest in gaining a clearer understanding of the current state of the environment. As a first step, I'm creating ways - like with this tool - to get first hand experience with environmental data. More to come.

This project leverages the [Google Maps Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/search-find-place) for location searching, and the [Open Weather Map One Call API](https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3) for sourcing weather data.
